    Make cake: Preheat oven to 350° and grease a bundt pan with butter then sprinkle with flour. Prepare cake mix according to package instructions then stir in cinnamon.
    Pour ⅓ of the batter into the greased bundt pan. Sprinkle with about a full layer of cinnamon-sugar. Pour another ⅓ of the batter then top with another layer of cinnamon-sugar. Pour the remaining batter on top, then very gently, drag a butter knife through the batter to create swirls.
    Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in pan then invert onto a cooling rack to cool completely.
    Make glaze: In a large liquid measuring cup (or a medium bowl), whisk together cream cheese, powdered sugar, milk and salt. Drizzle over the cooled cake.
    Let set for 10 minutes, then slice and serve.
