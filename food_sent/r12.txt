    2 c. creamy caesar dressing, plus more for serving
    1 c. chicken broth
    1 lb. Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
    1 tbsp. lemon juice
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 c. finely grated Parmesan
    1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
    4 ciabatta rolls

Directions

    Add the first five ingredients in the bowl of a slow cooker and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Cook on high heat for 3-4 hours.
    When the chicken is cooked, drain most of the liquid. Shred the breast meat with two forks in the bowl of the slow cooker. Toss with more caesar dressing.
